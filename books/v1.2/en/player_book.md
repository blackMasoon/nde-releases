# Player Book

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

- The GM describes the situation and options.
- You say what you do and what result you want.
- If the outcome is uncertain, the GM tells you:
  1) which attribute you use (S/D/M),
  2) the difficulty (TN),
  3) what happens on failure.
- You roll a single attribute die and check if result ≥ TN.


### The shortest rule
Roll your attribute die. Result ≥ TN = success.



<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

You have:
- a Role (Warrior / Rogue / Mage),
- 3 Attributes: Strength (S), Dexterity (D), Magic (M),
- Hearts (life) and Mana,
- 2 Talents (optional but recommended),
- gear.


### 2.1 What the attributes do
- Strength (S): melee, forcing, lifting, endurance.
- Dexterity (D): shots, precision, stealth, dodging, acrobatics.
- Magic (M): special effects (spells/psionics/tech — setting dependent).


### 2.2 Attribute dice
Each attribute has a die (d6, d8, d10, d12, d20). You always roll one die.
- Bigger die = better odds of high results.


### 2.3 Hearts and Mana
- Hearts: 5 (start).
- Mana: 3 (start). Spend it when using Magic.



<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Step 1: Pick a role
This sets your starting dice:
- Warrior: S d10, D d6, M d6
- Rogue:   S d6,  D d10, M d6
- Mage:    S d6,  D d6,  M d10


### Step 2: Note resources
- Hearts: 5
- Mana: 3


### Step 3: Pick 2 Talents (optional)
Short keywords that describe strengths.
- Neutral examples: Negotiator, Scout, Mechanic, Medic, Athlete, Analyst, Hacker.

How Talents work: if a Talent truly helps, the GM may lower TN by one step.
- Usually 1 Talent per test.
- Talent doesn’t replace description — it helps when it actually applies.


### Step 4: Gear
List:
- one combat tool (melee or ranged),
- protection (if appropriate),
- 3 utility items.

Gear mostly acts as permission: you have it, so you can try certain things.


### Example character
- Role: Rogue
- S d6, D d10, M d6
- Hearts 5, Mana 3
- Talents: Scout, Negotiator
- Gear: ranged tool, lockpicks, rope, light source



<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### 4.1 When you roll
You roll when it’s risky/uncertain and failure matters.

If it’s obvious and pressure‑free, GM can say “it works”.


### 4.2 Difficulty (TN)
Four bands:
- TN 4 — Easy
- TN 6 — Standard
- TN 8 — Hard
- TN 12 — Heroic

The GM sets TN. No need to guess — the GM tells you.


### Wyniki Testu

> **Target Number (TN)**: 4 (Easy), 6 (Normal), 8 (Hard).
> 
> **Roll Result:**
> - **1**: Failure + Complication.
> - **< TN**: Failure.
> - **≥ TN**: Success.
> - **Max (10/20)**: Success + Benefit.

---

### 4.3 Outcomes
- Result ≥ TN: success.
- Result < TN: failure.
- Roll a 1: failure with a complication.
- Max on the die (e.g., 10 on d10): critical success + extra benefit.

Extra benefit examples: faster, quieter, safer, bigger effect, better position.


### 4.4 Shifting difficulty by a step
Instead of math, the GM shifts TN by one step:
- worse conditions → TN up (e.g., 6 → 8),
- better conditions → TN down (e.g., 8 → 6).

Your job: create better conditions via description (cover, prep, tools, plan).


### 4.5 Help from an ally
An ally can spend their Action to help. For that roll you may bump your die:
- d6→d8→d10→d12→d20.

The help must make sense (covering, distraction, handing tools).


### Test example
You try to open a blocked passage quickly.
- GM: “Dexterity, TN 6.”
- You roll D d10 = 7 → success: passage opens.



<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

- 1 square is the basic unit of distance.
- Movement per turn: up to 5 squares.
- Diagonals count as 1.
- Cover matters: ranged attacks into cover are harder.



<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### 6.1 Your turn
- Move up to 5 squares and take 1 Action.

Actions include: attack, use gear, attribute test, help, use Magic.


### Atak

> Translation pending...

---

### 6.2 Attacks
- Melee: Strength roll.
- Ranged: Dexterity roll.
- The GM states the foe’s TN.

Default foe TN:
- Minion: 6
- Elite: 8
- Boss: 12


### Trafienie

> Translation pending...

### 6.3 What a hit means
- Minion → out of the fight.
- Elite/Boss → takes a Wound (Boss has 3 total).
- Critical vs Elite/Boss → usually +1 Wound (total 2) or one positional boon (push, eject from cover).


### Pudło i Odwet

> Translation pending...

### 6.4 Misses and retaliation
If you miss (result < TN) and the foe could hit back, you lose 1 Heart.
- Common in melee.
- At range it depends on cover/position.

Tactical lesson: position yourself to avoid retaliation on a miss (cover, distance, plan, help).


### 0 Serc

> Translation pending...

---

### 6.5 At 0 Hearts
- You’re down and can’t act.
- An ally can spend an Action to bring you to 1 Heart.


### Short turn example
- Move: dash 3 squares to cover.
- Action: shoot (D). GM: “TN 6, but target has cover → TN 8.” You roll d10=9 → hit.



<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

Magic is the “special effects” mechanic. You describe the effect; the GM sets TN and Mana cost.


### 7.1 Costs and tiers
- Trick: TN 4, cost 0–1
- Standard: TN 6, cost 1
- Strong: TN 8, cost 2
- Great power: TN 12, cost 3


### 7.2 Failure in Magic
If it fails:
- you lose the Mana spent, and
- a consequence appears (e.g., −1 Heart, exposed, extra threat).


### 7.3 Critical magic
Max roll with Magic grants an extra boon:
- bigger area/range,
- longer duration,
- higher potency,
- or reduced cost (GM may refund 1 Mana).


### Magic example
You try a short 5‑square “blink”.
- GM: “Standard: TN 6, cost 1.”
- You pay 1 Mana, roll M d10=7 → success behind cover.



<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

After a conflict, if you have a safe moment and basic rest conditions:
- Hearts and Mana return to full.



<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

After an adventure choose one:
- bump S/D/M die size: d6→d8→d10→d12→d20,
- or +1 Heart (max 7),
- or +1 Mana (max 5).



<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

If you only have a d6, replace die sizes with thresholds:
- Master 3+, Trained 4+, Novice 5+, Untrained 6.

The GM may raise/lower your threshold by one step for situation or help.



<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

- Always say what you do and why. Intent helps the GM pick clear stakes.
- If TN is high, don’t brute‑force the roll — change the situation (cover, tools, help, new route).
- Coordinate: one helps, the other rolls.
- In combat, cover and position often matter more than the roll.
