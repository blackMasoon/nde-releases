<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

- Same terminology as the Basic Rules and GM books.
- Only players roll. Opponents apply pressure via TN and moves; damage usually comes from retaliation or forced tests.



<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

> Name — Class, TN, Wounds, Role, Move, Special

- Class: Minion | Elite | Boss
- TN: the number 4/6/8/12 to hit/outmaneuver the foe.
- Wounds: for Elite and Boss only (default: Elite 2, Boss 3). Minions have no Wounds (they drop on a hit).
- Role: Brute (melee), Skirmisher (mobile), Artillery (ranged), Controller (area/control), Support (buffs/debuffs).
- Move: default 5 squares; change if mobility is defining (e.g., 6 Fast, Flying, Jump 3).
- Special: one or two short capabilities (see Traits and Moves).

Example: “Elite Guard — Elite, TN 8, Wounds 2, Brute, Move 5, Special: Heavy Cover; Push.”



<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

- Minion: TN 6, drops on 1 hit. Pressure by numbers. Retaliation on a miss: −1 Heart.
- Elite: TN 8, 2 Wounds. Usually 1 defensive trait or mobility edge. Retaliation on a miss: −1 Heart; sometimes an extra situational effect.
- Boss: TN 12, 3 Wounds. Has 2–3 special moves and shapes terrain/tempo. Can force PC tests (evasion, stabilize, etc.).



<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

- Brute: presses in melee, pushes from cover.
- Skirmisher: darts in/out, punishes isolated PCs.
- Artillery: fires from cover, forces movement.
- Controller: creates threat zones, smoke/fields, pushes/pulls.
- Support: strengthens allies, shifts TN (±1 step) situationally.



<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

Add 1–2 to a block. Purely descriptive; only shift TN by a step if it makes sense.
- Natural Cover: usually has partial cover at range (attacks against it → TN +1 step).
- Light Armor: the first 1‑Heart retaliation on this unit in a scene is ignored.
- Tough: the first success against this unit doesn’t inflict a Wound (only displacement/position) — good for bosses.
- Fast (Move 6): ignores 1 square of difficult terrain each turn.
- Climber/Jumper: treats vertical/obstacle movement as regular; jump 3.
- Flying: ignores ground obstacles (ensure reasonable cover exists).
- Scout: harder to ambush; the first stealth attempt against it is TN +1.
- Resistance [type]: the first effect of that type in a scene is reduced (GM defines how: shorter, smaller, weaker).
- Vulnerability [type]: attacks of that type have TN −1 step.
- Swarm: when adjacent, retaliation on a miss may affect two PCs within 1 square.



<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

Pick 1–2 signature moves. If they threaten PCs, the GM may call for an appropriate PC test (D or M) vs the foe’s TN.
- Push (Brute): on a hit, also move the target 1–2 squares.
- Break Cover: when this unit hits, the target’s cover stops working until the end of next round.
- Slip (Skirmisher): entering/leaving melee doesn’t trigger retaliation.
- Volley (Artillery): 3×3 area; all inside test D vs TN; failure: −1 Heart and push 1 square.
- Anchor (Controller): a 3×3 zone becomes “sticky” (entering costs the Action) until end of next round.
- Bolster (Support): one ally is 1 step easier to protect/aid until end of round (attackers against it face TN +1).
- Summon (Boss): once per fight, brings in 2 minions in free squares.
- Barrier (Boss): until the end of the enemy phase, PCs’ ranged attacks are TN +1.
- Shockwave (Boss): all within 2 squares test S vs TN; on failure: −1 Heart or knocked down (lose Move this turn).



<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

1) Pick class: Minion / Elite (2 Wounds) / Boss (3 Wounds).
2) Set TN: 6 / 8 / 12 (rarely 4 for very weak, 10 for tough elites).
3) Choose a role: Brute, Skirmisher, Artillery, Controller, Support.
4) Add 1–2 traits and 1 move (Boss: 2–3 moves).
5) Move: usually 5; change only if it matters.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

Hazards are mindless opponents or environmental effects. They trigger on turns or conditions.
Format: Name — TN, Effect, How to Disable
- Turret — TN 8, Effect: on the enemy phase each PC in line tests D vs TN; failure: −1 Heart; Disable: M or D TN 8 at the panel.
- Snap Trap — TN 6, Effect: entering the cell forces a D test; failure: restrained or −1 Heart; Disable: D TN 6 with tools.

- Gas/Smoke — TN 6, Effect: in a 3×3 area, test M or D; failure: blinded zone/−1 Heart; Disable: vent (S) or seal (D).



<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

Pick one from each line (or roll d6):
1. Scene goal: cross / retrieve / disable / escort / steal / defend
2. Terrain focus: open / narrow corridors / multi‑level / modular cover / dangerous edges / fog‑smoke
3. Opposition: 6× minion / 4× minion + elite / 2× elite / boss / boss + 2× minion / elite + hazard
4. Enemy edge: cover / height / mobility / time clock / chokepoints / remote support
5. PC edge: surprise / higher ground / tools / short barrier / shortcut / neutral ally



<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

Use steps instead of numeric TNs:
- Minion: “Standard” (≈ TN 6)
- Elite: “Hard” (+1 step)
- Boss: “Heroic” (+2 steps) and 3 Wounds
Traits and moves stay the same; when a note says “TN +1”, raise the step.



<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

- If fights end too quickly: add minions in waves (2/round) or raise TN by a step for enemies with positional advantage.
- If fights drag: offer more critical opportunities via position, or lower TN for weakened foes.
- Two elites ≈ small boss; boss + 4 minions ≈ a two‑hour session finale.



<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

- Defensive Guard — Minion, TN 6, —, Artillery, Move 5, Special: Natural Cover.
- Mobile Patrol — Minion, TN 6, —, Skirmisher, Move 6, Special: Scout.
- Heavy Assault — Elite, TN 8, Wounds 2, Brute, Move 5, Special: Light Armor; Push.
- Field Tactician — Elite, TN 8, Wounds 2, Controller, Move 5, Special: Anchor; Bolster.
- Field Commander — Boss, TN 12, Wounds 3, Support, Move 5, Special: Summon; Barrier; Bolster.
- Terrain Colossus — Boss, TN 12, Wounds 3, Brute, Move 5, Special: Tough; Shockwave; Push.
